🎤 The Premise Debater (Tribute)

Project Overview

This application is designed to simulate a political debate with a prominent conservative commentator. Users enter any political premise or statement, and the app utilizes the Gemini model, guided by a sophisticated system prompt, to generate a detailed, assertive, and foundationally conservative rebuttal.

Key Features:

Persona Modeling: The LLM adopts a specific, assertive conservative persona, ensuring consistent tone and argumentation.

Structured Debate: The rebuttal is organized into clear sections: a Core Premise Challenge, a Conservative Rebuttal, and a motivational Closing Thought.

Standalone Deployment: Designed for quick, reliable deployment on Streamlit Cloud using a dedicated repository.
