## 3. Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

The files are now correct locally. We need to send this update back to the cloud.

1.  **Stage the Changes:**
    * In the VS Code terminal (or the integrated one):
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```

2.  **Commit the Changes (Record the Change):**
    * Write a clear message for the history log:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Fixed secrets.toml location to .streamlit/secrets.toml"
        ```

3.  **Push to GitHub (Send to the Cloud):**
    * This command sends your local commit to the `main` branch on GitHub:
        ```bash
        git push origin main
